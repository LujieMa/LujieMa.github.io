Currently, I am a master's student and a math education researcher in International Education Policy and Management program at [Vanderbilt University Peabody College](https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/academics/masters-programs/international-education-policy-and-management-med/). My research interests lie in **spatial reasoning**, **embodied intervention design**, and **neuroscience evidence** for students' different math performance.
